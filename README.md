<h3>Welcome to the world of Blibo</h3>
</div>

Blibo is a two players game with twenty five tiles on a board. The mission is to cover as much tiles as possible with the player’s own coloured cards { Player1: Green Cards, Player2: Blue Cards}. But there is more to it then just simply putting the coloured cards over the white tiles. The board is magical :)  Each tile of the board is linked with the tiles around it and becomes friendly with the coloured cards placed over it. The tile once covered can be used again to change the colours of the tiles around it, providing the player a chance to increase his/her territory. But for that he/she must know the capital of the state or union territory diplayed at the bottom. At the end when there are no more tiles left or if someone resigns, the player with most tiles covered with his/her coloured cards wins the match.
